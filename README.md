# Customer API
A sample design for a RESTful API using RAML that contains a single resource, customers, and allows the following:
* List customers
* Create a new customer
* Update a customer
* Delete a customer

This version of the API uses the [jsonapi](http://jsonapi.org/) standard. For design decisions not related to jsonapi, refer to the original version of the API at [raml-sample](https://github.com/tnabil/raml-sample).
